        <h3>Trapped Within</h3>

        <div class="abouttheproduct2">
        <h4>This poster was for my Communication Studio II class. We were instructed to pick a podcast, listen to it and create a poster not directly relating to the podcast itself but referencing it in some way. The podcast I chose to listen to was titled Notes from the Underground. It was about the terrorist attack in Tokyo, Japan in 1995. I chose to create a city trapped within a cage, similar to the individuals who were trapped in the subway trains during the gas attack.</h4>
