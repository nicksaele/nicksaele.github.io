        <h3>Playa del Rey Florist</h3>

        <div class="abouttheproduct2">
        <h4>The poster was for my class titled Communication Studio. . At the beginning of this project, we were asked to choose an objet, place and a word. My object was a palm tree, my place was Playa Del Rey Florist and my word was geometric. For the final poster, which is shown above, I decided to combine both a flower and a palm tree, which is why each flower has a trunk. When I first started designing this, all the flowers were the same size and it looked a little boring. I wanted to make it look more dynamic so I started playing around with the sizes of the flowers. When I was playing around with the colors, I originally wanted each flower to be a different color but it looked very 1970s when I did that. I then decided to make if different shades of purple and threw in some pink as well.</h4>
