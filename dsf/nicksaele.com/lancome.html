        <h3>M by Lancome</h3>

        <div class="abouttheproduct">
        <h4>M by Lancome is a skin care line created for my Package Design class. We were instructed to pick a manufacturer of skin care products and create a specific line for that company. We then had to create and design 3 cartons with 2 bottles and 1 squeeze tube, I chose to create an extra bottle to fit the purpose of my line. Lancome is a company I have always admired and to my knowledge they have never released products exclusively for men so I thought, why not create this for my project?</h4>
