<div id="first"> <p>When I fell in love my heart was on fire </p> 
<p>To be with you was my one desire </p>
<p>And if you love me</p>
<p>I'll give you everything you need</p>
<p>A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams</p> 
<p>For only my heart knows what it means</p>
<p>And I promise you it won't be wrong</p>
<p>One love, two hearts we will make it strong,</p>
<p>But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss </p>
<p>Honey when I'm alone you're the one I miss </p>
<p>And your sweet, tender love is hard to resist</p>
<p>Darling it's true my heart has fallen in love with you </p>
<p>Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might</p>
<p>Hoping someday you will realize this passion </p>
<p>I hold inside </p></div>

<div id="second"> <p>Honey it doesn't cost a dime. </p>
<p>And if you give in your love could be mine I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me</p>
<p>Accompany by faith and much understanding</p>
<p>And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity</p>
<p>As my heart flies by with angel wings </p>
<p>And the clouds form into wedding rings </p>
<p>A woman in love the angels sing </p>
<p>On and on a soft melody </p>
<p>That's how it feels to be in love like me. </p>
<p>For thoughts from the heart are never ending </p> </div>
