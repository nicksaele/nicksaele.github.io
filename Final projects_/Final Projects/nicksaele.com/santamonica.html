        <h3>Santa Monica Pier</h3>

        <div class="abouttheproduct2">
        <h4>This poster was for my class titled Communication Studio. At the beginning of this project, we were asked to choose an objet, place and a word. We then had to create a poster based around those 3 principles. My words were palm tree, Santa Monica Pier and geometric so, I had to create a poster for Santa Monica Pier representing a palm tree while also demonstrating my word, geometric. While there are may iterations leading up to this final piece, I decided to create a Ferris wheel out of palm trees. I wanted the title at the bottom to speak more to the poster itself rather than just slapping text at the bottom of my composition so I decided to add lines through out the entire composition. In my personal opinion I think this helps with the design of the poster, without the lines I feel as though it might be a little too boring to look at. For the colors chosen, I went with a dark blue background to give it more of a night feel so the lights on the palm trees would stand out more. There is also a slight glow behind the Ferris wheel as well.</h4>
