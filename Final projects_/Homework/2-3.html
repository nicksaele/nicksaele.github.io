<p><strong>When I fell in love my heart was on fire </strong></p>
<em>To be with you was my one desire </em>
<p><strong>And if you love me</strong></p>
<em>I'll give you everything you need <em>
<p><strong>A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams</strong></p>
<em>For only my heart knows what it means <em>
<p><strong>And I promise you it won't be wrong </strong></p>
<em>One love, two hearts we will make it strong, <em>
<p><strong>But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss </strong></p>
<em>Honey when I'm alone you're the one I miss <em>
<p><strong>And your sweet, tender love is hard to resist</strong></p>
<em>Darling it's true my heart has fallen in love with you <em>
<p><strong>Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might</strong></p>
<em>Hoping someday you will realize this passion <em>
<p><strong>I hold inside </strong></p>
<em>Honey it doesn't cost a dime. 
<p><strong>And if you give in your love could be mine I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me</strong></p>
<em>Accompany by faith and much understanding<em>
<p><strong>And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity</strong></p>
<em>As my heart flies by with angel wings <em>
<p><strong>And the clouds form into wedding rings </strong></p>
<em>A woman in love the angels sing <em>
<p><strong>On and on a soft melody </strong></p>
<em>That's how it feels to be in love like me. <em>
<p><strong>For thoughts from the heart are never ending </strong></p>
