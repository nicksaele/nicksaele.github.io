<p>When I fell in 

<h4><srong>love</srong></h4> 
<em>my heart was on fire</p>
<p>To be with you was my one desire</p>
<p>And if you </em>

<strong><h4>love</h4></strong> me</p>
<p>I'll give you everything you need </p>
<p>A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams </p>
<p>For only my heart knows what it means </p>
<p>And I promise you it won't be wrong </p>
<p>One 

<strong><h4>love</h4></strong><em>, two hearts we will make it strong, </p>
<p>But now my </em>

<strong><h4>love</h4></strong> is lost in your sweet kiss </p>
<p>Honey when I'm alone you're the one I miss </p>
<p>And your sweet, tender love is hard to resist</p>
<p>Darling it's true my heart has fallen in love with you </p>
<p>Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might</p>
<p>Hoping someday you will realize this passion </p>
<p>I hold inside </p>
<p>Honey it doesn't cost a dime. </p>
<p>And if you give in your 


<strong><h4>love</h4></strong> <em>could be mine I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me</p>
<p>Accompany by faith and much understanding</p>
<p>And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity</p>
<p>As my heart flies by with angel wings </p>
<p>And the clouds form into wedding rings </p>
<p>A woman in </em>


<strong><h4>love</h4></strong> the angels sing </p>
<p>On and on a soft melody </p>
<p>That's how it feels to be in love like me. </p>
<p>For thoughts from the heart are never ending </p>
