<p><strong><h2>When I fell in love</h2></strong>
<ul>
<li> my heart was on fire</li>
</ul></p>
<p><em>To be with you was my one desire</em></p>
<p><strong><h2>And if you love me</h2></strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>I'll give you everything you need</li>
</ul> </p>
<p><em>A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams </p>
<p>For only my heart knows what it means</em> </p>
<p><strong><h2>And I promise</h2></strong> 
</ul>
<ul><li>you it won't be wrong</li> </p>
<p><li>One love, two hearts we will make it strong,</li> 

</ul></p>
<p><em>But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss </p>
<p>Honey when I'm alone you're the one I miss </p>
<p>And your sweet, tender love is hard to resist</em></p>
<p><strong><h2>Darling it's true</h2></strong> 
<ul><li>my heart has fallen in love with you</li> </p>
<p><li>Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might</li></p>
<p><li>Hoping someday you will realize this passion</li>
</ul> </p>
<p><em>I hold inside </p>
<p>Honey it doesn't cost a dime.</em></p>
<p><strong><h2>And if you give in your love could be mine</h2></strong> 
<ul><li>I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me</li></ul></p>
<p><em>Accompany by faith and much understanding</p>
<p>And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity</p>
<p>As my heart flies by with angel wings </p>
<p>And the clouds form into wedding rings </p>
<p>A woman in love the angels sing </p>
<p>On and on a soft melody </p>
<p>That's how it feels to be in love like me. </p>
<p>For thoughts from the heart are never ending </p></em>
