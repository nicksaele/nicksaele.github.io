<p> <strong>When I fell in love my <h2>heart</h2> was on fire 
To be with you was my one desire 
And if you love me
I'll give you everything you need 
A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams 
For only my <h2>heart</h2> knows what it means 
And I promise you it won't be wrong 
One love, two <h2>hearts</h2> we will make it strong, 
But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss 
Honey when I'm alone you're the one I miss 
And your sweet, tender love is hard to resist
Darling it's true my <h2>heart</h2> has fallen in love with you </strong> </p>

<br><br><br><br><br>


<p> <em> Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might
Hoping someday you will realize this passion 
I hold inside 
Honey it doesn't cost a dime. 
And if you give in your love could be mine I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me
Accompany by faith and much understanding
And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity
As my <h2>heart</h2> flies by with angel wings 
And the clouds form into wedding rings 
A woman in love the angels sing 
On and on a soft melody 
That's how it feels to be in love like me. 
For thoughts from the <h2>heart</h2> are never ending </em> </p>
